Collect animals and birds in brand new collectors game - Birds Pen. It has rhythm-based gameplay with difficulty levels. Turn mystery pods into pets, make your home bigger, and make sure each incubator is perfectly upgraded to create better pets.

To get new pets, you first need to incubate them. Put a pod into a incubator and start heating it up. Tap it and catch the needle within the green zone. This will fill the Warmth bar. Maintain the temperature for 30 seconds, and you'll hatch a new pet. When you successfully hatch a pet, you'll get coins and XP. Pets relax in your home and over time generate extra coins. They can also occasionally produce new pods for you to cultivate.

With coins you can buy new pods, special items, or to upgrade incubators, which will make getting new pets easier. This is especially important as you progress through the game and need to merge more warmers at the same time. You can also use special items when facing difficulties to snatch through and get a pet. Here are some of them:
The hourglass shortens the hatching time.
The snowflake halts the warmer's heat bar.
The heart replenishes the warmer's heat bar.
